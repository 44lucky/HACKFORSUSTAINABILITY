# HACKFORSUSTAINABILITY
Problem:- 
Approx. 9 percent of the global population is suffering from hunger and there is the issue of quality of food, and the main challenge is to get the right food to the right places with minimal time and cost. 
As Much of the worldâ€™s food is grown by small-scale, independent farms and these farms suffer from the problem like crop disease. 

Solution:- 
If we can tackled this problem at initial stage then there is possibility of producing healthy crop. 
This can be achieved by using machine learning and deep learning based model, and then inspecting whether the crop is healthy or not (disease free),and if it is contaminated so getting right suggestion and advice for its treatment. 
This approach can be efficacious as we will be able to predict the cause at initial stage and then we can deliver healthy food.
